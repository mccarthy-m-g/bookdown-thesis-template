# Welcome {-}

This is the online version of *The Bookdown Thesis Template*.

The Bookdown Thesis Template is a comprehensive bookdown template, covering everything you need to write, edit, and disseminate your thesis. [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) is is an [open-source R package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) that facilitates writing books and long-form articles or reports with R Markdown. Features include:

- Generate printer-ready books and ebooks from R Markdown documents.
- A markup language easier to learn than LaTeX, and to write elements such as section headers, lists, quotes, figures, tables, and citations.
- Multiple choices of output formats: PDF, LaTeX, HTML, EPUB, and Word.
- Possibility of including dynamic graphics and interactive applications (HTML widgets and Shiny apps).
- Support a wide range of languages: R, C/C++, Python, Fortran, Julia, Shell scripts, and SQL, etc.
- LaTeX equations, theorems, and proofs work for all output formats.
- Can be published to GitHub, bookdown.org, Netlify, and any web servers.
- Integrated with the RStudio IDE.

You can learn more about using bookdown to write your thesis in the short book [*bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).
