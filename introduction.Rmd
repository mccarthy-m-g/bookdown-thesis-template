# Introduction

This section of the Bookdown Thesis Template includes a mock thesis that you can use as the skeleton for your thesis. It makes use of the papaja package [@R-papaja] to print important numbers and statistics using values from code---this means that if any numbers in the code change, so too will those numbers change in the body of the thesis.

For this thesis we will simulate data for a two group between-subjects experiment. Here is the code to simulate our data: 

```{r simulate-data}
# load package
library(dplyr)
# seed for random number generation
set.seed(43)
# create dataset
df_ind_t.test <- tibble::tibble(ID = 1:100,
                                Gender = c(rep("Male", 40),
                                           rep("Female", 60)
                                           ),
                                IV = c(rep("A", 50),
                                       rep("B", 50)
                                       ),
                                DV = c(round(rnorm(n = 50, mean = 150, sd = 20)),
                                       round(rnorm(n = 50, mean = 100, sd = 17))
                                       )
                                )
# encode IV as a factor
df_ind_t.test$IV <- factor(df_ind_t.test$IV, levels = c("A", "B"))
```

For this experiment we will test the hypothesis that participants in group A had significantly higher scores on the dependent variable than participants in group B.
